# rusty_raytracer_pt2

This project follows the tutorial [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html) in Rust. 

I am working in Rust so that I write my own code, the tutorial uses C++. 

I have completed the chapters on Motion Blur, Bounding Volume Heirarchies and Texture Mapping. I am currently working on Perlin Noise.
